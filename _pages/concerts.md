    - My biggest dream in life was to watch Metallica live at least once. The feeling of touching such a dream can not be expressed in words. Seems like luck was in my favor too that day. My ticket was at 6th level. But due to some technical issues, I got admitted in the ground and watched them live just from 10 feet away. What a memory to live with!!!
