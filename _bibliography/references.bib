    abstract="Computerized systems capable of generating high-level story descriptions have many potential real-life applications. However, enabling computers to do so requires teaching computers to obtain an abstract understanding of natural language stories algorithmically, which is one of the non-trivial problems in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing.
In this dissertation, we tackle the challenge of automatically characterizing stories at a high-level by generating a set of tags from narrative texts written in English. We start by presenting a background study on the problem, discuss the required resources for research, and propose a new corpus to facilitate research on high-level story understanding by selecting tag prediction for movies as an application of this problem. Then, we focus on designing methods for high-level story understanding from written narratives and predicting tags for movies from the written plot synopses. First, we employ a wide range of linguistic features to design a machine learning approach for generating descriptive tags for stories from narrative texts. At the next step, we design a neural methodology for modeling the flow of emotions throughout stories and enhance a system that uses a high-level representation of narrative texts to predict tags. We furthermore exploit the hierarchical structure of text documents to encode the synopses and strengthen the tag prediction mechanism. In the final part of this dissertation, we demonstrate a technique utilizing user reviews to generate tags for characterizing stories at a high-level. We made the new dataset, the source code of the systems, and a live tag prediction system publicly available to the community to encourage further exploration in the direction of automatic story characterization.",

Unfortunately, these proposed methods are hardly generalizable to different code-switched languages. In addition, it is unclear whether a model architecture is applicable for a different task while still being compatible with the code-switching setting. This is mainly because of the lack of a centralized benchmark and the sparse corpora that researchers employ based on their specific needs and interests. To facilitate research in this direction, we propose a centralized benchmark for Linguistic Code-switching Evaluation (LinCE) that combines eleven corpora covering four different code-switched language pairs (i.e., Spanish-English, Nepali-English, Hindi-English, and Modern Standard Arabic-Egyptian Arabic) and four tasks (i.e., language identification, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and sentiment analysis). As part of the benchmark centralization effort, we provide an online platform where researchers can submit their results while comparing with others in real-time. In addition, we provide the scores of different popular models, including LSTM, ELMo, and multilingual BERT so that the NLP community can compare against state-of-the-art systems. LinCE is a continuous effort, and we will expand it with more low-resource languages and tasks.",

    abstract = "Observing the damages that can be done by the rapid propagation of fake news in various sectors like politics and finance, automatic identification of fake news using linguistic analysis has drawn the attention of the research community. However, such methods are largely being developed for English where low resource languages remain out of the focus. But the risks spawned by fake and manipulative news are not confined by languages. In this work, we propose an annotated dataset of {\mbox{$\approx$}} 50K news that can be used for building automated fake news detection systems for a low resource language like Bangla. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the dataset and develop a benchmark system with state of the art NLP techniques to identify Bangla fake news. To create this system, we explore traditional linguistic features and neural network based methods. We expect this dataset will be a valuable resource for building technologies to prevent the spreading of fake news and contribute in research with low resource languages.

  abstract="Folksonomy of movies covers a wide range of heterogeneous information about movies, like the genre, plot structure, visual experiences, soundtracks, metadata, and emotional experiences from watching a movie. Being able to automatically generate or predict tags for movies can help recommendation engines improve retrieval of similar movies, and help viewers know what to expect from a movie in advance. In this work, we explore the problem of creating tags for movies from plot synopses. We propose a novel neural network model that merges information from synopses and emotion flows throughout the plots to predict a set of tags for movies. We compare our system with multiple baselines and found that the addition of emotion flows boosts the performance of the network by learning ≈18% more tags than a traditional machine learning system.",

 abstract="Social tagging of movies reveals a wide range of heterogeneous information about movies, like the genre, plot structure, soundtracks, metadata, visual and emotional experiences. Such information can be valuable in building automatic systems to create tags for movies. Automatic tagging systems can help recommendation engines to improve the retrieval of similar movies as well as help viewers to know what to expect from a movie in advance. In this paper, we set out to the task of collecting a corpus of movie plot synopses and tags. We describe a methodology that enabled us to build a fine-grained set of around 70 tags exposing heterogeneous characteristics of movie plots and the multi-label associations of these tags with some 14K movie plot synopses. We investigate how these tags correlate with movies and the flow of emotions throughout different types of movies. Finally, we use this corpus to explore the feasibility of inferring tags from plot synopses. We expect the corpus will be useful in other tasks where analysis of narratives is relevant.",
